### Changes to crops:

+ All crops are unfertilize-able in the traditional manner. You can now only use Bone Meal on the farmland that a crop grows on to speed it up 2x.
+ Carrots, Potatoes, Wheat & Beetroots have been made to only grow once per day, instead of randomly.
+ Carrots are farmed in 2 stages. First you plant seeds, and from those you get more carrots which you can then use for food or plant for more seeds.
+ Wheat doesn't drop seeds on harvesting blocks anymore, instead you must craft Wheat (found in villages normally or through loot) into seeds, which leaves behind a new item (Straw) and also gives 2 seeds to plant.
+ Potatoes only drop 1 and sometimes 2 potatoes when harvested.
+ Beetroots drop rarely 2 and always 1 when harvested.
+ Overhauled Sugar Cane! It now grows only from a Sugar Cane Roots item and can also be planted diagonally from water source blocks (vanilla only allows planting to adjacent ones).
+ Sweet Berries are no longer plantable and can only be harvested/eaten.
+ Cocoa Beans will now only have a 25% chance to drop 2 seeds when harvested and fully grown. This puts emphasis and importance on making a proper farm for them.
+ All farmland planted crops revert to normal dirt when the crop is harvested. This puts importance on Hoe items and gives a better incentive to craft higher tier ones.

### Misc changes
+ Hay bale item is now crafted with Straw instead of Wheat to remove early game acquiring of easy wheat from villages
+ Fern and short/tall grass no longer drop wheat seeds.
